Sprayer robot
- does have gps
- and rtk
- maybe private LTE radio?

Andrew's Plan
- give robot a path
- do john deere or other rate controller
- use off the shelf gps system to run the implement
- John deere starfire system 
- Opp system is easy to send data to remotely

John Deere setup is gonna cost as much as robot and sprayer
- check if amiga can connect to raven rate controller
