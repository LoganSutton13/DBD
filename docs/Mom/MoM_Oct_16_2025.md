## Agenda Items

### 1. Farm ng Documentation Review
**Discussion**: 
- Farm ng documentation specifies sending prescription map and path map as two separate things
- For now, focus on creating a simple path map
- Distance between paths needs to be variable (between rows)
- Consider bigger sprayers with larger boom requirements
- Pick heading in degrees (robot will follow heading)
- Knowledge center reference: https://farm-ng.com/knowledge-center/

**Outcome**: 
- Decided to start with a simple path map implementation
- Identified need for variable distance between paths

### 2. GPS Control System Decision
**Discussion**: 
- Not using John Deere ATU (Automated Tillage Unit) due to cost
- Using GPS built into control system of robot instead
- Could still use John Deere to control variable rate spraying

**Outcome**: 
- Decision made to use built-in robot GPS control system
- John Deere may still be used for variable rate spraying control

### 3. Shape Files Research
**Discussion**: 
- Need to look into shape files
- Shape files are likely needed for field boundary and path planning

**Outcome**: 
- Identified need to research shape file implementation

### 4. Robot Software Updates
**Discussion**: 
- Will need to update the robot's software
- John Manager app may have some path planning built into it

**Outcome**: 
- Confirmed need for robot software updates
- John Manager app identified as potential resource

## Action Items
| Task | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Research shape files implementation |  |  |  |
| Update robot software |  |  |  |
| Investigate John Manager app path planning capabilities |  |  |  |
| Implement variable distance between paths |  |  |  |

## Decisions Made
1. **GPS Control**: Decided to use GPS built into robot control system instead of John Deere ATU
2. **Path Map Approach**: Start with simple path map implementation
3. **Variable Rate Spraying**: May still use John Deere for variable rate spraying control
4. **Path Configuration**: Distance between paths should be variable to accommodate different sprayer sizes

## Key Discussion Points
- Farm ng documentation requirements for prescription and path maps
- Cost considerations for John Deere ATU vs. built-in GPS
- Variable path distance requirements for different sprayer configurations
- Heading selection in degrees for robot path following
- Shape file research needs
- Robot software update requirements

## Issues/Risks Identified
- **Cost**: John Deere ATU is too costly for implementation
- **Software Updates**: Robot software will need updates
- **Path Planning**: Need to ensure path planning functionality meets requirements

## Next Steps
- Research shape files
- Update robot software
- Investigate John Manager app capabilities
- Implement variable distance between paths
- Continue development of path map functionality

## Next Meeting

- **Agenda Preview**: 

## Additional Notes
- Farm ng knowledge center is a key resource: https://farm-ng.com/knowledge-center/
- Path map and prescription map are separate components in Farm ng system
- Heading selection in degrees allows robot to follow specific directions
