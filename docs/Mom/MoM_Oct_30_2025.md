## Agenda Items

### 1. Field Path Optimization
**Discussion**: 
- Discussed how to create field path with least number of turns
- Need to consider boundary constraints
- Tweak grid to follow heading (change angle of grid)

**Outcome**: 
- Identified need to optimize path planning to minimize turns
- Confirmed importance of boundary consideration
- Grid angle adjustment needed to follow heading

### 2. Application Containerization
**Discussion**: 
- Want to put app into Docker container for portability
- Docker containerization will improve deployment and distribution

**Outcome**: 
- Decision made to containerize application using Docker

### 3. Project Proposal
**Discussion**: 
- Need to complete project proposal

**Outcome**: 
- Identified project proposal as priority task

## Action Items
| Task | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Implement field path optimization with minimal turns |  |  |  |
| Consider boundary constraints in path planning |  |  |  |
| Tweak grid to follow heading (adjust grid angle) |  |  |  |
| Containerize app in Docker container |  |  |  |
| Complete project proposal |  |  |  |

## Decisions Made
1. **Path Optimization**: Implement field path planning with least number of turns
2. **Boundary Consideration**: Ensure path planning accounts for field boundaries
3. **Grid Configuration**: Adjust grid angle to follow heading requirements
4. **Containerization**: Move application to Docker container for portability

## Key Discussion Points
- Field path optimization strategies
- Boundary constraint handling
- Grid angle adjustment for heading following
- Docker containerization benefits
- Project proposal completion status

## Issues/Risks Identified
- **Path Optimization**: Need to balance minimal turns with boundary constraints
- **Grid Alignment**: Grid angle needs to be adjustable to match heading requirements
- **Project Proposal**: Needs to be completed

## Next Steps
- Implement path optimization algorithm
- Integrate boundary constraints into path planning
- Adjust grid configuration for heading following
- Set up Docker containerization
- Complete project proposal

## Next Meeting
- **Date**: 
- **Time**: 
- **Location**: 
- **Agenda Preview**: 

## Additional Notes
- Path planning should minimize number of turns while respecting boundaries
- Grid angle adjustment is important for proper heading following
- Docker containerization will improve application portability
