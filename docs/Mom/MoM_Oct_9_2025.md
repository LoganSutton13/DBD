## Agenda Items

### 1. Agro Manager Tool Discussion
**Discussion**: 
- Online farm management tool that takes processed data
- Creates a task map with option to download
- Can be used after creating shape file
- Good reference for building the system

**Outcome**: 
- Identified as a potential tool to use after shape file creation

### 2. Stitching Options Configuration
**Discussion**: 
- Default or custom tab for slider options
- Drop down starts closed
- Configuration options include:
  - Grid size (width of robot)
  - Boom size
  - Heading

**Outcome**: 
- Defined configuration parameters for stitching options

### 3. Sprayer Robot Specifications
**Discussion**: 
- Robot has GPS capability
- Robot has RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) capability
- Possibly has private LTE radio

**Outcome**: 
- Confirmed GPS and RTK capabilities of sprayer robot

### 4. Implementation Plan Discussion
**Discussion**: 
- Andrew's plan involves giving robot a path
- Consider using John Deere or other rate controller
- Use off-the-shelf GPS system to run the implement
- John Deere Starfire system mentioned
- OPP system is easy to send data to remotely
- John Deere setup cost is comparable to robot and sprayer combined
- Need to check if Amiga can connect to Raven rate controller

**Outcome**: 
- Discussed various implementation approaches
- Identified need to verify Amiga connectivity to Raven rate controller

## Action Items
| Task | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Check if Amiga can connect to Raven rate controller |  |  |  |
| Research agro manager tool for shape file integration |  |  |  |

## Decisions Made
1. **Agro Manager Tool**: Identified as a useful reference tool for building the system
2. **Stitching Configuration**: Defined parameters including grid size, boom size, and heading
3. **Implementation Approach**: Discussed multiple options including John Deere systems and rate controllers

## Key Discussion Points
- Agro manager tool capabilities and integration potential
- Configuration options for stitching functionality
- Sprayer robot specifications (GPS, RTK, LTE radio)
- Implementation plan considerations and cost analysis
- Connectivity requirements between Amiga and rate controllers

## Issues/Risks Identified
- **Cost Concern**: John Deere setup cost is significant (comparable to robot and sprayer)
- **Connectivity**: Need to verify Amiga compatibility with Raven rate controller

## Next Steps
- Verify Amiga connectivity to Raven rate controller
- Further research on agro manager tool integration
- Continue development of stitching configuration options

## Next Meeting
- **Date**: 
- **Time**: 
- **Location**: 
- **Agenda Preview**: 

## Additional Notes
- John Deere Starfire system and OPP system were discussed as potential solutions
- Cost-benefit analysis needed for John Deere setup
